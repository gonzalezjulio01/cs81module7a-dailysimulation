# Reflection

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?
I wanted the schedule to feel chill and realistic like a normal day. I included things like waking up and scrolling, having noodles for lunch, gaming, and watching a show. I wasn’t trying to be too serious.I just showed the flow of a simple but familiar day.

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
The only small challenge was keeping track of the delays so everything showed in the right order. Once I set it up properly with the time gaps, everything worked fine and felt smooth.

## What does this assignment teach you about async code?
It helped me understand how setTimeout lets JavaScript do things over time instead of all at once. You can control when things appear without blocking the rest of the code, which is pretty useful for anything time-based like animations and events.

## What creative element did you add?
I added a surprise event at the end of the day. It picks a random twist and makes the output feel less repetitive. It also adds a bit of fun to the simulation.

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
It’s obviously simplified, but it kind of matches how time passes in a day; one thing after another and sometimes with unexpected moments. It’s not super realistic but it gets the idea across in a cool and visual way.
